CPSC2120 Project 2: cpriest, Caleb Priester

Contained in this folder ae the contents that make up Project 2.  There is a 
graph with a header and c++ file.  There is also a driver that reads in a file
of data to build a dictionary and a graph, and then reads another file 
containing many pairs of numbers to build paths using two methods: Shortest 
Paths and MCST.  Every ten successful searches results in the most recently 
searched pair being removed from the dictionary and graph, and every five
failed searches results in the numbers in the pair not already contained in the
dictionary and added to the dictionary and graph.  A new MCST is built every 
time the graph changes.  There are two methods for building MCSTs contained in
the graph class, so each time buildMCST is called, one of the two is randomly
selected for the building process.  Also contained are the files that I used to
test the speeds of the two methods used for finding pathways.  The Makefile 
creates all necessary executables when "make" is typed in.  To run the testing 
programs, the code to print the shortest path mush be commented out of the 
shortestPath method in graph.cpp.  Enjoy.
